            <p>
                Ankole Cattle, whose origins can be traced back all the way to 
                Ancient Egypt thanks to their presence in hieroglyphics from the period
                The Ankole-Watusi is a modern American breed of domestic cattle. 
                It derives from the Ankole group of Sanga cattle breeds of east and central Africa. It is characterized by very large horns.
            </p>
            <p> They are also considered to be a yardstick for warriors and wee also considered as a beautiful divine incarnation.
                 The cattle is reared for both milk and meat purposes although the skin can also be used for making cultural regalia like drums, stools, sandals and clothing.
