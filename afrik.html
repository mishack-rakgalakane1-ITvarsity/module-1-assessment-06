            <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>
                The Afrikaner, also known as the Africander, is a breed of taurine-indicine ("Sanga") cattle indigenous to South Africa.
                Huge herds of Sanga type cattle were herded by the Khoikhoi (Hottentots) when the Dutch established the Cape Colony in 1652. Although African cattle breeds originated from domesticized Auerochsen in the Middle East, 
                there has been considerable introgression from wild African cattle (Bos Taurus Africanus) in North Africa, from the 8th millennium B. C. onwards, 
            </p>
            <p> These breeds also share other features of stature and hardiness, fertility and endurance with the Afrikaaner cattle.
                 For the understanding of Afrikaaner cattle and their special valuable traits, comparisons with other African breeds might thus be fruitful, 
                to assess the genetic contribution of African wild cattle.
                Afrikaners are used commercially to produce beef, and are often crossbred with other breeds in order to improve meat quality, particularly in regards to tenderness, as well as their greater ability to add weight on poor quality forage.
                 The South African breed society promotes the use of Afrikaners as a dam line for crossbreeding.
