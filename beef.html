            <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
            <p>
                Beefmaster cattle are the first American composite breed (combination of three or more breeds). These cattle have been developed by the Lasater Ranch then headquartered in Texas. The breeding program leading to their establishment was started by Ed C. Lasater in 1908,
                 when he purchased Brahman bulls to use on his commercial herd of Hereford and Shorthorn cattle (Beefmaster cattle are 50% Brahman, 25% Hereford, and 25% Milking Shorthorn).

                The first of these bulls that he used were principally of Gir breeding, although some of the Nelore breed were also used. In 1925 he introduced Guzerat blood into the herd.
                </p>
            <p>In South Africa, we have our own hybrid breed, the Bonsmara, which is incredibly similar,
                 being a cross between the Hereford, Shorthorn and native Afrikaner breeds.
                 They are resistant to insects due to their thick skin.
                  Just like the Brahman cattle,they live longer than many other breeds, often producing calves at ages 15 and older.
